## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis to uncover patterns and key factors contributing to churn.
- Supervised Learning Models: Predictive models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to identify customers likely to churn.
- Unsupervised Clustering: Application of K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on shared behavioral and financial attributes.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, ensuring efficient clustering without compromising accuracy.
- Actionable Insights: Detailed analysis of cluster characteristics to inform targeted marketing and personalized retention strategies.

## Technical Stack
